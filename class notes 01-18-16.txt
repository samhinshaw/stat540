Go over this math again (matrix multiplication, dot & cross products)

column number of first matrix must equal row number of second matrix

redo slide 15 in vector notation
power calculation! how many samples do you need?

microarray, one color vs two color

detecting and removing outliers (versus possible biological variation). Calculate the distance! One metric is the Mahalanobis Distance.  Could be interesting, but if included would ruin statistical analysis. This cannot be informed by your experimental design

For microarray, could be defect on array or region of array. etc.
sample bias & confounding factors <- hardest to tell
    could because of another factor unaddressed in experimental design
housekeeping genes for microarray? difficult, or not? creatine or creatinine? still some variability attached to this

"spike-in" a known amount of RNA & normalize to that

"global distribution" making two strong statistical assumptions about your data. 
    - Linear: Mean or median centering
    - Non-linear: quantile normalization
Assumption 1: MOST genes shouldn't be differentially expressed, so overall shifts in intensity are assumed to be technical
Assumption 2: Similar numbers of genes will be upregulated as downregulated, so generating a distribution will have the same mean
    - I don't think either of these assumptions are any good, #2 definitely doesn't seem true
MA plots & MA normalization typically based on two-color array data. Look up this!

Loess or spline
^ two color
quantile normalization more often used for one color microarrays
matches distribution of data across different samples
adjust values across multiple samples

can use quantile on two-color normalization, after per-array normalization has been finished.  

filtering data to remove not expressed genes!
remove genes with missing values, low expression, or low stdev
unsupervised!!
