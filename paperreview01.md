#### Overview
Typhoid, or typhoid fever is a global epidemic caused by the bacterium *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi, otherwise known as *S Typhi*, and the emergence of a multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strain is a cause of global concern.  The H58 lineage has been spreading over Africa and Asia over the past 30 years, replacing antibiotic-sensitive strains, and making treatment of typhoid more difficult.  
The goal of this paper was to conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the MDR typhoid lineage of the *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi H58, and to determine its origin and pattern of spread.  

#### Data
Here, data was subgenomic and whole-genome sequencing of 1,832 different S Typhi samples collected between 1992 to 2013.  A total of five samples were sequenced on PacBio's SMRT platform, allowing for better resolution of plasmid integration into the bacterial chromosome.  The raw sequence data are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), under accession identifier [ERP001718](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP001718).  Most of these files are outputs from Illumina HiSeq machines, with outputs downloadable as FASTQ formats.
