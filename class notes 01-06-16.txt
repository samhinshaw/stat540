Basic stats refresher
Look up these terms:
• Random variable (RV) and its distribution	
• IID	
• Parameters of a distribution	
• An estimator of a parameter	
• A parameter space	
• Null and alternative	hypotheses	
• The sampling distribution of an estimator	
• Large sample results for averages	

Random variable: function that maps outcome of expt to a real number...?
RV = number of heads observed
capital letters (X,Y) are used to define random variables, whereas their lowercase counterparts are used to represent the outcomes or OBSERVED values
probability function rather than table of outcomes. probability distribution is a math function for describing possible outcomes
prob mass function (discrete) & prob density function (continuous)
Bernoulli dist models outcomes for random var with two outcomes (discrete)
Binomial dist models binary outcomes
Uniform distribution
Gaussian distribution, diff shapes depend on mean & variance
t-distribution, depends on degrees of freedom


Back to prisoner example:
How many times did we get 7 heads in 10,000 experiments?
we've got the binomial distribution! and we have the parameters
answer is approx 1172 out of 10,000

in first example we look at binomial dist guess vs rbinom RNG, = 0.0027
in second example we look at runif RNG vs rbinom RNG, = 0.0009

much harder to guess experiment given outcomes.  basically have to guess & check model on theoretical vs empirical. make assumptions & check

Hypothesis testing...
pick an actual question & define null
then pick test statistic & compute probabilities

IID = independent & identically distributed
identically distributed = hold same distribution
independence crucial as well
B - type II error is (false negative?)
a - type I error is (false positive?)
