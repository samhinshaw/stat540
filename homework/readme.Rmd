Welcome to my homework subdir!

Here you can find my various homework documents:  
- [R Markdown source code](./SamHinshawHomework.Rmd)  
- [Pretty Markdown (.md) file](./SamHinshawHomework.md)  
- [Even more beautiful HTML report](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT540-UBC/zz_hinshaw-samuel_STAT540_2016/master/homework/SamHinshawHomework.html?token=ANh2FV4oGzvXu1BWoj3xEZJxJJBLMZiOks5W9YHXwA%3D%3D)  
- [Makefile](./Makefile)  

If my `htmlpreview.github.io/?` version isn't working (it hasn't been for me recently), you can save the HTML file locally and view it in your browser.
